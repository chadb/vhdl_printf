# vhdl_printf

This vhdl package implements printf for vhdl.  It allows you to do formatted printing to a LINE type.

## History

This was an open source package developed by easics.com in 2001.  The only think I have done is created a repo on github and uploaded it.  I did reformat this README file and added a license file.  Below is the original readme file:

Installation
============

VHDL-1987
---------
To install PCK_FIO, define a VHDL library called EASICS_PACKAGES, and
analyze the VHDL file PCK_FIO_1987.vhd and PCK_FIO_1987_BODY.vhd into this library.

To install the test bench, analyze TB_PCK_FIO_1987.vhd into the same library.

VHDL-1993
---------
To install PCK_FIO, define a VHDL library called EASICS_PACKAGES, and
analyze the VHDL file PCK_FIO_1993.vhd and PCK_FIO_1993_BODY.vhd into this library.

To install the test bench, analyze TB_PCK_FIO_1993.vhd into the same library.

Numeric packages
----------------
If you want to use IEEE.std_logic_arith instead of IEEE.numeric_std, you need
to edit the source code of the package, both header and body, and the test bench
and replace the package use clause. PCK_FIO works with either of these packages.

Documentation
-------------
To install the documentation, put the file point PCK_FIO.html in a path of
your choosing, point your web browser to it, and bookmark it.


Installation check
==================

After installing the test bench, you should run it. The corresponding VHDL
design unit is EASICS_PACKAGES.TBE_PCK_FIO(TB).

Simulating the test bench should create a file called PCK_FIO.out. This file
should be identical to PCK_FIO.out.gold. Any difference indicates a portability
issue or a simulator non-compliance or bug.
