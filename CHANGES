Changes from version 1.16 to version 2002.07
============================================

PCK_FIO is now distributed under the GNU Lesser General Public Licencse
instead of the ordinary GPL, to better reflect intended usage.

Cosmetic changes in source code to correct some typos in the testbench output.
A new testbench is also supplied.

The package now uses IEEE.numeric_std as default.

URL http://www.easics.com has been made part of address.

Changed syntax in the PCK_FIO package and its testbench to support VHDL-1993.
Because of backwards-incompatibility, it has been necessary to supply
different sets of files for 1987 and 1993.

Split the packages into a separate file for the header and a
separate file for the body (in compliance with Easics' guidelines).

These changes resulted in the files:

Files for VHDL-1993: 
--------------------
  PCK_FIO_1993.vhd : 	 the source code of the header file for the package
  PCK_FIO_1993_BODY.vhd: the source code of the body of the package
  TB_PCK_FIO_1993.vhd:   the testbench for the package 

Files for VHDL-1987:
--------------------
  PCK_FIO_1987.vhd:      the source code of the header file for the package
  PCK_FIO_1987_BODY.vhd: the source code of the body of the package
  TB_PCK_FIO_1987.vhd:   the testbench for the package 

Updated README and PCK_FIO.html to support these changes.

Adapted package files to support NUL termination of strings.
fo(Arg: string) now prints the string until the first NUL.
Several examples of its use are demonstrated in the supplied testbenches.

Made cosmetic changes to code to improve readability.
